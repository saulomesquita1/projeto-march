        <p>
            There's miles of land in front of us <br>
            And we're dying with every step we take <br>
            We're dying with every breath we make <br>
            And I'll fall in line <br>
            <br>
            A stranger's back is all I see <br>
            He's only a few feet in front of me <br>
            And I'll look left and right sometimes <br>
            But I'll fall in line <br>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="imagem" id="img1">
        <p>
            No one looks up anymore <br>
            'Cause you might get a raindrop in your eye <br>
            And heaven forbid they see you cry <br>
            As we fall in line <br>
            <br>
            And about this time every year <br>
            The line will go to the ocean pier <br>
            And walk right off into the sea <br>
            And then we fall asleep <br>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="branco">
        <p>
            And as we near the end of land <br>
            And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand <br>
            I ask myself the question <br>
            Why I fall in line <br>
        <br>
            Then out of the corner of my eye <br>
            I see a spaceship in the sky <br>
            And hear a voice inside my head <br>
            Follow me instead <br>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="imagem" id="img2">

            Then the wages of war will start <br>
            Inside my head with my counterpart <br>
            And the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase <br>
            This line's the only way <br>
            <br>
            And then I start down the stand <br>
            My eyes are focused on the end of land <br>
            But again the voice inside my head says <br>
            Follow me instead <br>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="branco" id="s5">
        <p>
            Take me up, seal the door <br>
            I don't want to march here anymore <br>
            I realize that this line is dead <br>
            So I'll follow you instead <br>
        <br>
            So then you put me back in my place <br>
            So I might start another day <br>
            And once again I will be <br>
            In a march to the sea <br>
        </p>
